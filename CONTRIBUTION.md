# Contribution
Hello!  
Hopefully you can profit from this project and if you feel like making this project greater then you are right here!
There are no rules that you need to follow when you it comes to contributing here. Of course there are some things that can help us to understand code, bugs or scripts components better but don't worry about it too much. Any form of contribution is warmly welcomed!

------

### Contribute Script Components
As mentioned above don't be scared that your scripts do not fit a certain code style or are too simple. Anything that fit's a purpose which didn't exist before will be valuable. Even if it only replaces 6 components.
[Here] I wrote my 6 guidelines on how to write more efficient Grasshopper script components. Maybe some of my experience can help you. If you think differently or your think that I forgot something feel free to contact me([Ueli])!

------

### Contribute Code
We make a great effort in trying to document all the code that is uploaded and yet we don't always manage. We know that after successfully making code work the last thing you want to do is spending more time to document it. In the moment everything seems so obvious. But it is vital that we can understand what you did and that another person can keep improving the code. This will save a lot of time of asking questions. In the end we all profit from it!
